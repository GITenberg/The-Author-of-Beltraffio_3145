<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> as I wished to see him I had
kept my letter of introduction three weeks in my
pocket-book.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was nervous and timid about meeting
him&mdash;conscious of youth and ignorance, convinced that he was
tormented by strangers, and especially by my country-people, and
not exempt from the suspicion that he had the irritability as
well as the dignity of genius.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the
pleasure, if it should occur&mdash;for I could scarcely believe
it was near at hand&mdash;would be so great that I wished to
think of it in advance, to feel it there against my breast, not
to mix it with satisfactions more superficial and
usual.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the little game of new sensations that I
was playing with my ingenuous mind I wished to keep my visit to
the author of &ldquo;Beltraffio&rdquo; as a
trump-card.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was three years after the publication
of that fascinating work, which I had read over five times and
which now, with my riper judgement, I admire on the whole as much
as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will give you about the date of my
first visit&mdash;of any duration&mdash;to England for you will
not have forgotten the commotion, I may even say the scandal,
produced by Mark Ambient&rsquo;s masterpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
the most complete presentation that had yet been made of the
gospel of art; it was a kind of &aelig;sthetic
war-cry.&nbsp;&nbsp; People had endeavoured to sail nearer to
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; in the cut of their sleeves and the shape of
their sideboards; but there had not as yet been, among English
novels, such an example of beauty of execution and
&ldquo;intimate&rdquo; importance of theme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing
had been done in that line from the point of view of art for
art.&nbsp;&nbsp; That served me as a fond formula, I may mention,
when I was twenty-five; how much it still serves I won&rsquo;t
take upon myself to say&mdash;especially as the discerning reader
will be able to judge for himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been in
England, briefly, a twelve-month before the time to which I began
by alluding, and had then learned that Mr. Ambient was in distant
lands&mdash;was making a considerable tour in the East; so that
there was nothing to do but to keep my letter till I should be in
London again.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was of little use to me to hear that
his wife had not left England and was, with her little boy, their
only child, spending the period of her husband&rsquo;s
absence&mdash;a good many months&mdash;at a small place they had
down in Surrey.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had a house in London, but
actually in the occupation of other persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; All this
I had picked up, and also that Mrs. Ambient was charming&mdash;my
friend the American poet, from whom I had my introduction, had
never seen her, his relations with the great man confined to the
exchange of letters; but she wasn&rsquo;t, after all, though she
had lived so near the rose, the author of
&ldquo;Beltraffio,&rdquo; and I didn&rsquo;t go down into Surrey
to call on her.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the Continent, spent the
following winter in Italy, and returned to London in
May.&nbsp;&nbsp; My visit to Italy had opened my eyes to a good
many things, but to nothing more than the beauty of certain pages
in the works of Mark Ambient.&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried his
productions about in my trunk&mdash;they are not, as you know,
very numerous, but he had preluded to &ldquo;Beltraffio&rdquo;
by, some exquisite things&mdash;and I used to read them over in
the evening at the inn.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used profoundly to reason
that the man who drew those characters and wrote that style
understood what he saw and knew what he was doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is my sole ground for mentioning my winter in
Italy.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been there much in former
years&mdash;he was saturated with what painters call the
&ldquo;feeling&rdquo; of that classic land.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
expressed the charm of the old hill-cities of Tuscany, the look
of certain lonely grass-grown places which, in the past, had
echoed with life; he understood the great artists, he understood
the spirit of the Renaissance; he understood
everything.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene of one of his earlier novels
was laid in Rome, the scene of another in Florence, and I had
moved through these cities in company with the figures he set so
firmly on their feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why I was now so much
happier even than before in the prospect of making his
acquaintance.</p>
<p>At last, when I had dallied with my privilege long enough, I
despatched to him the missive of the American poet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He had already gone out of town; he shrank from the rigour of the
London &ldquo;season&rdquo; and it was his habit to migrate on
the first of June.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover I had heard he was this
year hard at work on a new book, into which some of his
impressions of the East were to be wrought, so that he desired
nothing so much as quiet days.&nbsp;&nbsp; That knowledge,
however, didn&rsquo;t prevent me&mdash;<i>cet &acirc;ge est sans
piti&eacute;</i>&mdash;from sending with my friend&rsquo;s letter
a note of my own, in which I asked his leave to come down and see
him for an hour or two on some day to be named by
himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; My proposal was accompanied with a very
frank expression of my sentiments, and the effect of the entire
appeal was to elicit from the great man the kindest possible
invitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; He would be delighted to see me,
especially if I should turn up on the following Saturday and
would remain till the Monday morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would take a
walk over the Surrey commons, and I could tell him all about the
other great man, the one in America.&nbsp;&nbsp; He indicated to
me the best train, and it may be imagined whether on the Saturday
afternoon I was punctual at Waterloo.&nbsp;&nbsp; He carried his
benevolence to the point of coming to meet me at the little
station at which I was to alight, and my heart beat very fast as
I saw his handsome face, surmounted with a soft wide-awake and
which I knew by a photograph long since enshrined on my
mantel-shelf, scanning the carriage-windows as the train rolled
up.&nbsp;&nbsp; He recognised me as infallibly as I had
recognised himself; he appeared to know by instinct how a young
American of critical pretensions, rash youth, would look when
much divided between eagerness and modesty.&nbsp;&nbsp; He took
me by the hand and smiled at me and said: &ldquo;You must
be&mdash;a&mdash;<i>you</i>, I think!&rdquo; and asked if I
should mind going on foot to his house, which would take but a
few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember feeling it a piece of
extraordinary affability that he should give directions about the
conveyance of my bag; I remember feeling altogether very happy
and rosy, in fact quite transported, when he laid his hand on my
shoulder as we came out of the station.</p>
<p>I surveyed him, askance, as we walked together; I had already,
I had indeed instantly, seen him as all delightful.&nbsp;&nbsp;
His face is so well known that I needn&rsquo;t describe it; he
looked to me at once an English gentleman and a man of genius,
and I thought that a happy combination.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a
brush of the Bohemian in his fineness; you would easily have
guessed his belonging to the artist guild.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was
addicted to velvet jackets, to cigarettes, to loose
shirt-collars, to looking a little dishevelled.&nbsp;&nbsp; His
features, which were firm but not perfectly regular, are fairly
enough represented in his portraits; but no portrait I have seen
gives any idea of his expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were
innumerable things in it, and they chased each other in and out
of his face.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen people who were grave and
gay in quick alternation; but Mark Ambient was grave and gay at
one and the same moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were other strange
oppositions and contradictions in his slightly faded and fatigued
countenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; He affected me somehow as at once fresh
and stale, at once anxious and indifferent.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had
evidently had an active past, which inspired one with curiosity;
yet what was that compared to his obvious future?&nbsp; He was
just enough above middle height to be spoken of as tall, and
rather lean and long in the flank.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had the
friendliest frankest manner possible, and yet I could see it cost
him something.&nbsp;&nbsp; It cost him small spasms of the
self-consciousness that is an Englishman&rsquo;s last and dearest
treasure&mdash;the thing he pays his way through life by
sacrificing small pieces of even as the gallant but moneyless
adventurer in &ldquo;Quentin Durward&rdquo; broke off links of
his brave gold chain.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been thirty-eight years
old at the time &ldquo;Beltraffio&rdquo; was
published.&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked me about his friend in America,
about the length of my stay in England, about the last news in
London and the people I had seen there; and I remember looking
for the signs of genius in the very form of his questions and
thinking I found it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked his voice as if I were
somehow myself having the use of it.</p>
<p>There was genius in his house too I thought when we got there;
there was imagination in the carpets and curtains, in the
pictures and books, in the garden behind it, where certain old
brown walls were muffled in creepers that appeared to me to have
been copied from a masterpiece of one of the
pre-Raphaelites.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the way many things struck
me at that time, in England&mdash;as reproductions of something
that existed primarily in art or literature.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
not the picture, the poem, the fictive page, that seemed to me a
copy; these things were the originals, and the life of happy and
distinguished people was fashioned in their image.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mark Ambient called his house a cottage, and I saw afterwards he
was right for if it hadn&rsquo;t been a cottage it must have been
a villa, and a villa, in England at least, was not a place in
which one could fancy him at home.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was, to my
vision, a cottage glorified and translated; it was a palace of
art, on a slightly reduced scale&mdash;and might besides have
been the dearest haunt of the old English <i>genius
loci</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It nestled under a cluster of magnificent
beeches, it had little creaking lattices that opened out of, or
into, pendent mats of ivy, and gables, and old red tiles, as well
as a general aspect of being painted in water-colours and
inhabited by people whose lives would go on in chapters and
volumes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lawn seemed to me of extraordinary
extent, the garden-walls of incalculable height, the whole air of
the place delightfully still, private, proper to
itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My wife must be somewhere
about,&rdquo; Mark Ambient said as we went in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We shall find her perhaps&mdash;we&rsquo;ve about an hour
before dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; She may be in the garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll show you my little place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed through the house and into the grounds, as I should
have called them, which extended into the rear.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
covered scarce three or four acres, but, like the house, were
very old and crooked and full of traces of long habitation, with
inequalities of level and little flights of steps&mdash;mossy and
cracked were these&mdash;which connected the different parts with
each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; The limits of the place, cleverly
dissimulated, were muffled in the great verdurous
screens.&nbsp;&nbsp; They formed, as I remember, a thick loose
curtain at the further end, in one of the folds of which, as it
were, we presently made out from afar a little group.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah there she is!&rdquo; said Mark Ambient; &ldquo;and she
has got the boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He noted that last fact in a
slightly different tone from any in which he yet had
spoken.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t fully aware of this at the
time, but it lingered in my ear and I afterwards understood
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your son?&rdquo; I inquired, feeling the question
not to be brilliant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my only child.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s always in
his mother&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp; She coddles him too
much.&rdquo;&nbsp; It came back to me afterwards too&mdash;the
sound of these critical words.&nbsp;&nbsp; They weren&rsquo;t
petulant; they expressed rather a sudden coldness, a mechanical
submission.&nbsp;&nbsp; We went a few steps further, and then he
stopped short and called the boy, beckoning to him
repeatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolcino, come and see your daddy!&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was something in the way he stood still and waited that made me
think he did it for a purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient had her
arm round the child&rsquo;s waist, and he was leaning against her
knee; but though he moved at his father&rsquo;s call she gave no
sign of releasing him.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lady, apparently a
neighbour, was seated near her, and before them was a
garden-table on which a tea-service had been placed.</p>
<p>Mark Ambient called again, and Dolcino struggled in the
maternal embrace; but, too tightly held, he after two or three
fruitless efforts jerked about and buried his head deep in his
mother&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a certain awkwardness
in the scene; I thought it odd Mrs. Ambient should pay so little
attention to her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I wouldn&rsquo;t for
the world have betrayed my thought, and, to conceal it, I began
loudly to rejoice in the prospect of our having tea in the
garden.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah she won&rsquo;t let him
come!&rdquo; said my host with a sigh; and we went our way till
we reached the two ladies.&nbsp;&nbsp; He mentioned my name to
his wife, and I noticed that he addressed her as &ldquo;My
dear,&rdquo; very genially, without a trace of resentment at her
detention of the child.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quickness of the
transition made me vaguely ask myself if he were perchance
henpecked&mdash;a shocking surmise which I instantly
dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient was quite such a wife as I
should have expected him to have; slim and fair, with a long neck
and pretty eyes and an air of good breeding.&nbsp; She shone with
a certain coldness and practised in intercourse a certain bland
detachment, but she was clothed in gentleness as in one of those
vaporous redundant scarves that muffle the heroines of
Gainsborough and Romney.&nbsp; She had also a vague air of race,
justified by my afterwards learning that she was &ldquo;connected
with the aristocracy.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have seen poets married to
women of whom it was difficult to conceive that they should
gratify the poetic fancy&mdash;women with dull faces and
glutinous minds, who were none the less, however, excellent
wives.&nbsp; But there was no obvious disparity in Mark
Ambient&rsquo;s union.&nbsp; My hostess&mdash;so far as she could
be called so&mdash;delicate and quiet, in a white dress, with her
beautiful child at her side, was worthy of the author of a work
so distinguished as &ldquo;Beltraffio.&rdquo;&nbsp; Round her
neck she wore a black velvet ribbon, of which the long ends, tied
behind, hung down her back, and to which, in front, was attached
a miniature portrait of her little boy.&nbsp; Her smooth shining
hair was confined in a net.&nbsp; She gave me an adequate
greeting, and Dolcino&mdash;I thought this small name of
endearment delightful&mdash;took advantage of her getting up to
slip away from her and go to his father, who seized him in
silence and held him high for a long moment, kissing him several
times.</p>
<p>I had lost no time in observing that the child, not more than
seven years old, was extraordinarily beautiful.&nbsp; He had the
face of an angel&mdash;the eyes, the hair, the smile of
innocence, the more than mortal bloom.&nbsp; There was something
that deeply touched, that almost alarmed, in his beauty,
composed, one would have said, of elements too fine and pure for
the breath of this world.&nbsp; When I spoke to him and he came
and held out his hand and smiled at me I felt a sudden strange
pity for him&mdash;quite as if he had been an orphan or a
changeling or stamped with some social stigma.&nbsp; It was
impossible to be in fact more exempt from these misfortunes, and
yet, as one kissed him, it was hard to keep from murmuring all
tenderly &ldquo;Poor little devil!&rdquo; though why one should
have applied this epithet to a living cherub is more than I can
say.&nbsp; Afterwards indeed I knew a trifle better; I grasped
the truth of his being too fair to live, wondering at the same
time that his parents shouldn&rsquo;t have guessed it and have
been in proportionate grief and despair.&nbsp; For myself I had
no doubt of his evanescence, having already more than once caught
in the fact the particular infant charm that&rsquo;s as good as a
death-warrant.</p>
<p>The lady who had been sitting with Mrs. Ambient was a jolly
ruddy personage in velveteen and limp feathers, whom I guessed to
be the vicar&rsquo;s wife&mdash;our hostess didn&rsquo;t
introduce me&mdash;and who immediately began to talk to Ambient
about chrysanthemums.&nbsp; This was a safe subject, and yet
there was a certain surprise for me in seeing the author of
&ldquo;Beltraffio&rdquo; even in such superficial communion with
the Church of England.&nbsp; His writings implied so much
detachment from that institution, expressed a view of life so
profane, as it were, so independent and so little likely in
general to be thought edifying, that I should have expected to
find him an object of horror to vicars and their ladies&mdash;of
horror repaid on his own part by any amount of effortless
derision.&nbsp; This proved how little I knew as yet of the
English people and their extraordinary talent for keeping up
their forms, as well as of some of the mysteries of Mark
Ambient&rsquo;s hearth and home.&nbsp; I found afterwards that he
had, in his study, between nervous laughs and free cigar-puffs,
some wonderful comparisons for his clerical neighbours; but
meanwhile the chrysanthemums were a source of harmony, he and the
vicaress were equally attached to them, and I was surprised at
the knowledge they exhibited of this interesting plant.&nbsp; The
lady&rsquo;s visit, however, had presumably been long, and she
presently rose for departure and kissed Mrs. Ambient.&nbsp; Mark
started to walk with her to the gate of the grounds, holding
Dolcino by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay with me, darling,&rdquo; Mrs. Ambient said to the
boy, who had surrendered himself to his father.</p>
<p>Mark paid no attention to the summons but Dolcino turned and
looked at her in shy appeal, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go with
papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when I ask you to stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t ask me, mamma,&rdquo; said the
child in his small clear new voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask you when I want you.&nbsp; Come to me,
dearest.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Ambient, who had seated herself
again, held out her long slender slightly too osseous hands.</p>
<p>Her husband stopped, his back turned to her, but without
releasing the child.&nbsp; He was still talking to the vicaress,
but this good lady, I think, had lost the thread of her
attention.&nbsp; She looked at Mrs. Ambient and at Dolcino, and
then looked at me, smiling in a highly amused cheerful manner and
almost to a grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;mamma wants me not
to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very tired&mdash;he has run about all
day.&nbsp; He ought to be quiet till he goes to bed.&nbsp;
Otherwise he won&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; These declarations
fell successively and very distinctly from Mrs. Ambient&rsquo;s
lips.</p>
<p>Her husband, still without turning round, bent over the boy
and looked at him in silence.&nbsp; The vicaress gave a genial
irrelevant laugh and observed that he was a precious little
pet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him choose,&rdquo; said Mark Ambient.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear little boy, will you go with me or will you stay
with your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; cried the vicar&rsquo;s
lady with increased hilarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, I don&rsquo;t think I can choose,&rdquo; the
child answered, making his voice very low and confidential.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been a great deal with mamma to-day,&rdquo;
he then added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very little with papa!&nbsp; My dear fellow, I
think you <i>have</i> chosen!&rdquo;&nbsp; On which Mark Ambient
walked off with his son, accompanied by re-echoing but
inarticulate comments from my fellow-visitor.</p>
<p>His wife had seated herself again, and her fixed eyes, bent on
the ground, expressed for a few moments so much mute agitation
that anything I could think of to say would be but a false
note.&nbsp; Yet she none the less quickly recovered herself, to
express the sufficiently civil hope that I didn&rsquo;t mind
having had to walk from the station.&nbsp; I reassured her on
this point, and she went on: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a thing that
might have gone for you, but my husband wouldn&rsquo;t order
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; After which and another longish pause, broken
only by my plea that the pleasure of a walk with our friend would
have been quite what I would have chosen, she found for reply:
&ldquo;I believe the Americans walk very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we always run,&rdquo; I laughingly allowed.</p>
<p>She looked at me seriously, yet with an absence in her pretty
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose your distances are so
great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we break our marches!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell
you the pleasure to me of finding myself here,&rdquo; I
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve the greatest admiration for Mr.
Ambient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll like that.&nbsp; He likes being
admired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have a very happy life, then.&nbsp; He has many
worshippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ve seen some of them,&rdquo; she
dropped, looking away, very far from me, rather as if such a
vision were before her at the moment.&nbsp; It seemed to
indicate, her tone, that the sight was scarcely edifying, and I
guessed her quickly enough to be in no great intellectual
sympathy with the author of &ldquo;Beltraffio.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
thought the fact strange, but somehow, in the glow of my own
enthusiasm, didn&rsquo;t think it important it only made me wish
rather to emphasise that homage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, you know,&rdquo; I returned&mdash;doubtless
with a due <i>suffisance</i>&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s quite the
greatest of living writers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t judge.&nbsp; Of course
he&rsquo;s very clever,&rdquo; she said with a patient cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing less than supreme, Mrs.
Ambient!&nbsp; There are pages in each of his books of a
perfection classing them with the greatest things.&nbsp;
Accordingly for me to see him in this familiar way, in his habit
as he lives, and apparently to find the man as delightful as the
artist&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much too good to be
true it seems and how great a privilege I think it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I knew I was gushing, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it, and what I
said was a good deal less than what I felt.&nbsp; I was by no
means sure I should dare to say even so much as this to the
master himself, and there was a kind of rapture in speaking it
out to his wife which was not affected by the fact that, as a
wife, she appeared peculiar.&nbsp; She listened to me with her
face grave again and her lips a little compressed, listened as if
in no doubt, of course, that her husband was remarkable, but as
if at the same time she had heard it frequently enough and
couldn&rsquo;t treat it as stirring news.&nbsp; There was even in
her manner a suggestion that I was so young as to expose myself
to being called forward&mdash;an imputation and a word I had
always loathed; as well as a hinted reminder that people usually
got over their early extravagance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assure you that
for me this is a red-letter day,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t take this up, but after a pause, looking
round her, said abruptly and a trifle dryly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
very much afraid about the fruit this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My eyes wandered to the mossy mottled garden-walls, where
plum-trees and pears, flattened and fastened upon the rusty
bricks, looked like crucified figures with many arms.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it promise well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the trees look very dull.&nbsp; We had such late
frosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was another pause.&nbsp; She addressed her
attention to the opposite end of the grounds, kept it for her
husband&rsquo;s return with the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is Mr.
Ambient fond of gardening?&rdquo; it occurred to me to ask,
irresistibly impelled as I felt myself, moreover, to bring the
conversation constantly back to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very fond of plums,&rdquo; said his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, then, I hope your crop will be better than you
fear.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lovely old place,&rdquo; I
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole impression&rsquo;s that of
certain places he has described.&nbsp; Your house is like one of
his pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed a bit frigidly amused at my glow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasant little place.&nbsp; There are
hundreds like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it has his <i>tone</i>,&rdquo; I laughed, but
sounding my epithet and insisting on my point the more sharply
that my companion appeared to see in my appreciation of her
simple establishment a mark of mean experience.</p>
<p>It was clear I insisted too much.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
tone?&rdquo; she repeated with a harder look at me and a slightly
heightened colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely he has a tone, Mrs. Ambient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he has indeed!&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t in the
least consider that I&rsquo;m living in one of his books at
all.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t care for that in the least,&rdquo;
she went on with a smile that had in some degree the effect of
converting her really sharp protest into an insincere joke.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not very literary.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;m not artistic,&rdquo; she stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sure you&rsquo;re not ignorant, not
stupid,&rdquo; I ventured to reply, with the accompaniment of
feeling immediately afterwards that I had been both familiar and
patronising.&nbsp; My only consolation was in the sense that she
had begun it, had fairly dragged me into it.&nbsp; She had thrust
forward her limitations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever I am I&rsquo;m very different from my
husband.&nbsp; If you like him you won&rsquo;t like me.&nbsp; You
needn&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp; Your liking me isn&rsquo;t in
the least necessary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t defy me!&rdquo; I could but honourably make
answer.</p>
<p>She looked as if she hadn&rsquo;t heard me, which was the best
thing she could do; and we sat some time without further
speech.&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient had evidently the enviable English
quality of being able to be mute without unrest.&nbsp; But at
last she spoke&mdash;she asked me if there seemed many people in
town.&nbsp; I gave her what satisfaction I could on this point,
and we talked a little of London and of some of its
characteristics at that time of the year.&nbsp; At the end of
this I came back irrepressibly to Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he like to be there now?&nbsp; I suppose
he doesn&rsquo;t find the proper quiet for his work.&nbsp; I
should think his things had been written for the most part in a
very still place.&nbsp; They suggest a great stillness following
on a kind of tumult.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; I
laboured on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose London&rsquo;s a tremendous
place to collect impressions, but a refuge like this, in the
country, must be better for working them up.&nbsp; Does he get
many of his impressions in London, should you say?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
proceeded from point to point in this malign inquiry simply
because my hostess, who probably thought me an odious chattering
person, gave me time; for when I paused&mdash;I&rsquo;ve not
represented my pauses&mdash;she simply continued to let her eyes
wander while her long fair fingers played with the medallion on
her neck.&nbsp; When I stopped altogether, however, she was
obliged to say something, and what she said was that she
hadn&rsquo;t the least idea where her husband got his
impressions.&nbsp; This made me think her, for a moment,
positively disagreeable; delicate and proper and rather
aristocratically fine as she sat there.&nbsp; But I must either
have lost that view a moment later or been goaded by it to
further aggression, for I remember asking her if our great man
were in a good vein of work and when we might look for the
appearance of the book on which he was engaged.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
every reason now to know that she found me insufferable.</p>
<p>She gave a strange small laugh as she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid you think I know much more about my husband&rsquo;s work
than I do.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t the least idea what he&rsquo;s
doing,&rdquo; she then added in a slightly different, that is a
more explanatory, tone and as if from a glimpse of the enormity
of her confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t read what he
writes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t succeed, and wouldn&rsquo;t even had she
tried much harder, in making this seem to me anything less than
monstrous.&nbsp; I stared at her and I think I blushed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you admire his genius?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
admire &lsquo;Beltraffio&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited, and I wondered what she could possibly say.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t speak, I could see, the first words that rose to
her lips; she repeated what she had said a few minutes
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh of course he&rsquo;s very
clever!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with this she got up; our two absentees
had reappeared.</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ambient</span> left me and went to
meet them; she stopped and had a few words with her husband that
I didn&rsquo;t hear and that ended in her taking the child by the
hand and returning with him to the house.&nbsp; Her husband
joined me in a moment, looking, I thought, the least bit
conscious and constrained, and said that if I would come in with
him he would show me my room.&nbsp; In looking back upon these
first moments of my visit I find it important to avoid the error
of appearing to have at all fully measured his situation from the
first or made out the signs of things mastered only
afterwards.&nbsp; This later knowledge throws a backward light
and makes me forget that, at least on the occasion of my present
reference&mdash;I mean that first afternoon&mdash;Mark Ambient
struck me as only enviable.&nbsp; Allowing for this he must yet
have failed of much expression as we walked back to the house,
though I remember well the answer he made to a remark of mine on
his small son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an extraordinary little boy of
yours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never seen such a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he asked while we went, &ldquo;do you call
him extraordinary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so beautiful, so fascinating.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s like some perfect little work of art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned quickly in the passage, grasping my arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t call him that, or
you&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in his hesitation he broke off suddenly, laughing at my
surprise.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards, however, he added:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make his little future very
difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I declared that I wouldn&rsquo;t for the world take any
liberties with his little future&mdash;it seemed to me to hang by
threads of such delicacy.&nbsp; I should only be highly
interested in watching it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Americans are very keen,&rdquo; he commented on
this.&nbsp; &ldquo;You notice more things than we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah if you want visitors who aren&rsquo;t struck with
you,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t have asked me
down here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed me my room, a little bower of chintz, with open
windows where the light was green, and before he left me said
irrelevantly: &ldquo;As for my small son, you know, we shall
probably kill him between us before we&rsquo;ve done with
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he made this assertion as if he really
believed it, without any appearance of jest, his fine
near-sighted expressive eyes looking straight into mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean by spoiling him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by fighting for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better give him to me to keep for you,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me remove the apple of discord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my extravagance of course, but he had the air of being
perfectly serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be quite the best thing
we could do.&nbsp; I should be all ready to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m greatly obliged to you for your
confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he lingered with his hands in his pockets.&nbsp; I felt as
if within a few moments I had, morally speaking, taken several
steps nearer to him.&nbsp; He looked weary, just as he faced me
then, looked preoccupied and as if there were something one might
do for him.&nbsp; I was terribly conscious of the limits of my
young ability, but I wondered what such a service might be,
feeling at bottom nevertheless that the only thing I could do for
him was to like him.&nbsp; I suppose he guessed this and was
grateful for what was in my mind, since he went on presently:
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the advantage of being an American, but I
also notice a little, and I&rsquo;ve an idea
that&rdquo;&mdash;here he smiled and laid his hand on my
shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;even counting out your nationality
you&rsquo;re not destitute of intelligence.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only
known you half an hour, but&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; For which again
he pulled up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very young, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you may treat me as if I could understand
you!&rdquo; I said; and before he left me to dress for dinner he
had virtually given me a promise that he would.</p>
<p>When I went down into the drawing-room&mdash;I was very
punctual&mdash;I found that neither my hostess nor my host had
appeared.&nbsp; A lady rose from a sofa, however, and inclined
her head as I rather surprisedly gazed at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
daresay you don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; she said with the modern
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mark Ambient&rsquo;s
sister.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon I shook hands with her, saluting
her very low.&nbsp; Her laugh was modern&mdash;by which I mean
that it consisted of the vocal agitation serving between people
who meet in drawing-rooms as the solvent of social disparities,
the medium of transitions; but her appearance was&mdash;what
shall I call it?&mdash;medieval.&nbsp; She was pale and angular,
her long thin face was inhabited by sad dark eyes and her black
hair intertwined with golden fillets and curious clasps.&nbsp;
She wore a faded velvet robe which clung to her when she moved
and was &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; as to the neck and sleeves, like the
garments of old Italians.&nbsp; She suggested a symbolic picture,
something akin even to D&uuml;rer&rsquo;s Melancholia, and was so
perfect an image of a type which I, in my ignorance, supposed to
be extinct, that while she rose before me I was almost as much
startled as if I had seen a ghost.&nbsp; I afterwards concluded
that Miss Ambient wasn&rsquo;t incapable of deriving pleasure
from this weird effect, and I now believe that reflexion
concerned in her having sunk again to her seat with her long lean
but not ungraceful arms locked together in an archaic manner on
her knees and her mournful eyes addressing me a message of
intentness which foreshadowed what I was subsequently to
suffer.&nbsp; She was a singular fatuous artificial creature, and
I was never more than half to penetrate her motives and
mysteries.&nbsp; Of one thing I&rsquo;m sure at least: that they
were considerably less insuperable than her appearance
announced.&nbsp; Miss Ambient was a restless romantic
disappointed spinster, consumed with the love of
Michael-Angelesque attitudes and mystical robes; but I&rsquo;m
now convinced she hadn&rsquo;t in her nature those depths of
unutterable thought which, when you first knew her, seemed to
look out from her eyes and to prompt her complicated
gestures.&nbsp; Those features in especial had a misleading
eloquence; they lingered on you with a far-off dimness, an air of
obstructed sympathy, which was certainly not always a key to the
spirit of their owner; so that, of a truth, a young lady could
scarce have been so dejected and disillusioned without having
committed a crime for which she was consumed with remorse, or
having parted with a hope that she couldn&rsquo;t sanely have
entertained.&nbsp; She had, I believe, the usual allowance of
rather vain motives: she wished to be looked at, she wished to be
married, she wished to be thought original.</p>
<p>It costs me a pang to speak in this irreverent manner of one
of Ambient&rsquo;s name, but I shall have still less gracious
things to say before I&rsquo;ve finished my anecdote, and
moreover&mdash;I confess it&mdash;I owe the young lady a bit of a
grudge.&nbsp; Putting aside the curious cast of her face she had
no natural aptitude for an artistic development, had little real
intelligence.&nbsp; But her affectations rubbed off on her
brother&rsquo;s renown, and as there were plenty of people who
darkly disapproved of him they could easily point to his sister
as a person formed by his influence.&nbsp; It was quite possible
to regard her as a warning, and she had almost compromised him
with the world at large.&nbsp; He was the original and she the
inevitable imitation.&nbsp; I suppose him scarce aware of the
impression she mainly produced, beyond having a general idea that
she made up very well as a Rossetti; he was used to her and was
sorry for her, wishing she would marry and observing how she
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Doubtless I take her too seriously, for she
did me no harm, though I&rsquo;m bound to allow that I can only
half-account for her.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t so mystical as she
looked, but was a strange indirect uncomfortable embarrassing
woman.&nbsp; My story gives the reader at best so very small a
knot to untie that I needn&rsquo;t hope to excite his curiosity
by delaying to remark that Mrs. Ambient hated her
sister-in-law.&nbsp; This I learned but later on, when other
matters came to my knowledge.&nbsp; I mention it, however, at
once, for I shall perhaps not seem to count too much on having
beguiled him if I say he must promptly have guessed it.&nbsp;
Mrs. Ambient, a person of conscience, put the best face on her
kinswoman, who spent a month with her twice a year; but it took
no great insight to recognise the very different personal paste
of the two ladies, and that the usual feminine hypocrisies would
cost them on either side much more than the usual effort.&nbsp;
Mrs. Ambient, smooth-haired, thin-lipped, perpetually fresh, must
have regarded her crumpled and dishevelled visitor as an
equivocal joke; she herself so the opposite of a Rossetti, she
herself a Reynolds or a Lawrence, with no more far-fetched note
in her composition than a cold ladylike candour and a
well-starched muslin dress.</p>
<p>It was in a garment and with an expression of this kind that
she made her entrance after I had exchanged a few words with Miss
Ambient.&nbsp; Her husband presently followed her and, there
being no other company, we went to dinner.&nbsp; The impressions
I received at that repast are present to me still.&nbsp; The
elements of oddity in the air hovered, as it were, without
descending&mdash;to any immediate check of my delight.&nbsp; This
came mainly, of course, from Ambient&rsquo;s talk, the easiest
and richest I had ever heard.&nbsp; I mayn&rsquo;t say to-day
whether he laid himself out to dazzle a rather juvenile pilgrim
from over the sea; but that matters little&mdash;it seemed so
natural to him to shine.&nbsp; His spoken wit or wisdom, or
whatever, had thus a charm almost beyond his written; that is if
the high finish of his printed prose be really, as some people
have maintained, a fault.&nbsp; There was such a kindness in him,
however, that I&rsquo;ve no doubt it gave him ideas for me, or
about me, to see me sit as open-mouthed as I now figure
myself.&nbsp; Not so the two ladies, who not only were very
nearly dumb from beginning to end of the meal, but who
hadn&rsquo;t even the air of being struck with such an exhibition
of fancy and taste.&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient, detached, and
inscrutable, met neither my eye nor her husband&rsquo;s; she
attended to her dinner, watched her servants, arranged the
puckers in her dress, exchanged at wide intervals a remark with
her sister-in-law and, while she slowly rubbed her lean white
hands between the courses, looked out of the window at the first
signs of evening&mdash;the long June day allowing us to dine
without candles.&nbsp; Miss Ambient appeared to give little
direct heed to anything said by her brother; but on the other
hand she was much engaged in watching its effect upon me.&nbsp;
Her &ldquo;die-away&rdquo; pupils continued to attach themselves
to my countenance, and it was only her air of belonging to
another century that kept them from being importunate.&nbsp; She
seemed to look at me across the ages, and the interval of time
diminished for me the inconvenience.&nbsp; It was as if she knew
in a general way that he must be talking very well, but she
herself was so at home among such allusions that she had no need
to pick them up and was at liberty to see what would become of
the exposure of a candid young American to a high &aelig;sthetic
temperature.</p>
<p>The temperature was &aelig;sthetic certainly, but it was less
so than I could have desired, for I failed of any great success
in making our friend abound about himself.&nbsp; I tried to put
him on the ground of his own genius, but he slipped through my
fingers every time and shifted the saddle to one or other of his
contemporaries.&nbsp; He talked about Balzac and Browning, about
what was being done in foreign countries, about his recent tour
in the East and the extraordinary forms of life to be observed in
that part of the world.&nbsp; I felt he had reasons for holding
off from a direct profession of literary faith, a full
consistency or sincerity, and therefore dealt instead with
certain social topics, treating them with extraordinary humour
and with a due play of that power of ironic evocation in which
his books abound.&nbsp; He had a deal to say about London as
London appears to the observer who has the courage of some of his
conclusions during the high-pressure time&mdash;from April to
July&mdash;of its gregarious life.&nbsp; He flashed his faculty
of playing with the caught image and liberating the wistful idea
over the whole scheme of manners or conception of intercourse of
his compatriots, among whom there were evidently not a few types
for which he had little love.&nbsp; London in short was grotesque
to him, and he made capital sport of it; his only allusion that I
can remember to his own work was his saying that he meant some
day to do an immense and general, a kind of epic, social
satire.&nbsp; Miss Ambient&rsquo;s perpetual gaze seemed to put
to me: &ldquo;Do you perceive how artistic, how very strange and
interesting, we are?&nbsp; Frankly now is it possible to be
<i>more</i> artistic, <i>more</i> strange and interesting, than
this?&nbsp; You surely won&rsquo;t deny that we&rsquo;re
remarkable.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was irritated by her use of the plural
pronoun, for she had no right to pair herself with her brother;
and moreover, of course, I couldn&rsquo;t see my way to&mdash;at
all genially&mdash;include Mrs. Ambient.&nbsp; Yet there was no
doubt they were, taken together, unprecedented enough, and, with
all allowances, I had never been left, or condemned, to draw so
many rich inferences.</p>
<p>After the ladies had retired my host took me into his study to
smoke, where I appealingly brought him round, or so tried, to
some disclosure of fond ideals.&nbsp; I was bent on proving I was
worthy to listen to him, on repaying him for what he had said to
me before dinner, by showing him how perfectly I
understood.&nbsp; He liked to talk; he liked to defend his
convictions and his honour (not that I attacked them); he liked a
little perhaps&mdash;it was a pardonable weakness&mdash;to
bewilder the youthful mind even while wishing to win it
over.&nbsp; My ingenuous sympathy received at any rate a shock
from three or four of his professions&mdash;he made me
occasionally gasp and stare.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t help
forgetting, or rather couldn&rsquo;t know, how little, in another
and drier clime, I had ever sat in the school in which he was
master; and he promoted me as at a jump to a sense of its
penetralia.&nbsp; My trepidations, however, were delightful; they
were just what I had hoped for, and their only fault was that
they passed away too quickly; since I found that for the main
points I was essentially, I was quite constitutionally, on Mark
Ambient&rsquo;s &ldquo;side.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the taken
stand of the artist to whom every manifestation of human energy
was a thrilling spectacle and who felt for ever the desire to
resolve his experience of life into a literary form.&nbsp; On
that high head of the passion for form the attempt at perfection,
the quest for which was to his mind the real search for the holy
grail&mdash;he said the most interesting, the most inspiring
things.&nbsp; He mixed with them a thousand illustrations from
his own life, from other lives he had known, from history and
fiction, and above all from the annals of the time that was dear
to him beyond all periods, the Italian cinque-cento.&nbsp; It
came to me thus that in his books he had uttered but half his
thought, and that what he had kept back from motives I deplored
when I made them out later&mdash;was the finer and braver
part.&nbsp; It was his fate to make a great many still more
&ldquo;prepared&rdquo; people than me not inconsiderably wince;
but there was no grain of bravado in his ripest things
(I&rsquo;ve always maintained it, though often contradicted), and
at bottom the poor fellow, disinterested to his finger-tips and
regarding imperfection not only as an &aelig;sthetic but quite
also as a social crime, had an extreme dread of scandal.&nbsp;
There are critics who regret that having gone so far he
didn&rsquo;t go further; but I regret nothing&mdash;putting aside
two or three of the motives I just mentioned&mdash;since he
arrived at a noble rarity and I don&rsquo;t see how you can go
beyond that.&nbsp; The hours I spent in his study&mdash;this
first one and the few that followed it; they were not, after all,
so numerous&mdash;seem to glow, as I look back on them, with a
tone that is partly that of the brown old room, rich, under the
shaded candle-light where we sat and smoked, with the dusky
delicate bindings of valuable books; partly that of his voice, of
which I still catch the echo, charged with the fancies and
figures that came at his command.&nbsp; When we went back to the
drawing-room we found Miss Ambient alone in possession and prompt
to mention that her sister-in-law had a quarter of an hour before
been called by the nurse to see the child, who appeared rather
unwell&mdash;a little feverish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feverish! how in the world comes he to be
feverish?&rdquo; Ambient asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was perfectly
right this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beatrice says you walked him about too much&mdash;you
almost killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beatrice must be very happy&mdash;she has an
opportunity to triumph!&rdquo; said my friend with a bright
bitterness which was all I could have wished it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not if the child&rsquo;s ill,&rdquo; I ventured
to remark by way of pleading for Mrs. Ambient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you aren&rsquo;t married&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t know the nature of wives!&rdquo; my host returned
with spirit.</p>
<p>I tried to match it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Possibly not; but I know the
nature of mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beatrice is perfect as a mother,&rdquo; sighed Miss
Ambient quite tremendously and with her fingers interlaced on her
embroidered knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go up and see my boy,&rdquo; her brother went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you suppose he&rsquo;s asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beatrice won&rsquo;t let you see him,
dear&rdquo;&mdash;as to which our young lady looked at me, though
addressing our companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call that being perfect as a mother?&rdquo;
Ambient asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from her point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn her point of view!&rdquo; cried the author of
&ldquo;Beltraffio.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he left the room; after which
we heard him ascend the stairs.</p>
<p>I sat there for some ten minutes with Miss Ambient, and we
naturally had some exchange of remarks, which began, I think, by
my asking her what the point of view of her sister-in-law could
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s so very odd.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;re so
very odd altogether.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you find us awfully unlike
others of our class?&mdash;which indeed mostly, in England, is
awful.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve lived so much abroad.&nbsp; I adore
&lsquo;abroad.&rsquo;&nbsp; Have you people like us in
America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not all alike, you interesting
three&mdash;or, counting Dolcino, four&mdash;surely, surely; so
that I don&rsquo;t think I understand your question.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve no one like your brother&mdash;I may go so far as
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve probably more persons like his
wife,&rdquo; Miss Ambient desolately smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you that better when you&rsquo;ve told me
about her point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;oh yes.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; said my
entertainer, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t like his ideas.&nbsp; She
doesn&rsquo;t like them for the child.&nbsp; She thinks them
undesirable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being quite fresh from the contemplation of some of Mark
Ambient&rsquo;s <i>arcana</i> I was particularly in a position to
appreciate this announcement.&nbsp; But the effect of it was to
make me, after staring a moment, burst into laughter which I
instantly checked when I remembered the indisposed child above
and the possibility of parents nervously or fussily anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has that infant to do with ideas?&rdquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely he can&rsquo;t tell one from
another.&nbsp; Has he read his father&rsquo;s novels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very precocious and very sensitive, and his
mother thinks she can&rsquo;t begin to guard him too
early.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Ambient&rsquo;s head drooped a little to
one side and her eyes fixed themselves on futurity.&nbsp; Then of
a sudden came a strange alteration; her face lighted to an effect
more joyless than any gloom, to that indeed of a conscious
insincere grimace, and she added &ldquo;When one has children
what one writes becomes a great responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children are terrible critics,&rdquo; I prosaically
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad I haven&rsquo;t
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you also write, then?&nbsp; And in the same style as
my brother?&nbsp; And do you like that style?&nbsp; And do people
appreciate it in America?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t write, but I think
I feel.&rdquo;&nbsp; To these and various other inquiries and
observations my young lady treated me till we heard her
brother&rsquo;s step in the hall again and Mark Ambient
reappeared.&nbsp; He was so flushed and grave that I supposed he
had seen something symptomatic in the condition of his
child.&nbsp; His sister apparently had another idea; she gazed at
him from afar&mdash;as if he had been a burning ship on the
horizon&mdash;and simply murmured &ldquo;Poor old
Mark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not anxious,&rdquo; I as promptly
pronounced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m disappointed.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t
let me in.&nbsp; She has locked the door, and I&rsquo;m afraid to
make a noise.&rdquo;&nbsp; I daresay there might have been a
touch of the ridiculous in such a confession, but I liked my new
friend so much that it took nothing for me from his
dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;She tells me&mdash;from behind the
door&mdash;that she&rsquo;ll let me know if he&rsquo;s
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of her,&rdquo; said Miss Ambient
with a hollow sound.</p>
<p>I had exchanged a glance with Mark in which it&rsquo;s
possible he read that my pity for him was untinged with contempt,
though I scarce know why he should have cared; and as his sister
soon afterward got up and took her bedroom candlestick he
proposed we should go back to his study.&nbsp; We sat there till
after midnight; he put himself into his slippers and an old
velvet jacket, he lighted an ancient pipe, but he talked
considerably less than before.&nbsp; There were longish pauses in
our communion, but they only made me feel we had advanced in
intimacy.&nbsp; They helped me further to understand my
friend&rsquo;s personal situation and to imagine it by no means
the happiest possible.&nbsp; When his face was quiet it was
vaguely troubled, showing, to my increase of interest&mdash;if
that was all that was wanted!&mdash;that for him too life was the
same struggle it had been for so many another man of
genius.&nbsp; At last I prepared to leave him, and then, to my
ineffable joy, he gave me some of the sheets of his forthcoming
book&mdash;which, though unfinished, he had indulged in the
luxury, so dear to writers of deliberation, of having &ldquo;set
up,&rdquo; from chapter to chapter, as he advanced.&nbsp; These
early pages, the <i>pr&eacute;mices</i>, in the language of
letters, of that new fruit of his imagination, I should take to
my room and look over at my leisure.&nbsp; I was in the act of
leaving him when the door of the study noiselessly opened and
Mrs. Ambient stood before us.&nbsp; She observed us a moment, her
candle in her hand, and then said to her husband that as she
supposed he hadn&rsquo;t gone to bed she had come down to let him
know Dolcino was more quiet and would probably be better in the
morning.&nbsp; Mark Ambient made no reply; he simply slipped past
her in the doorway, as if for fear she might seize him in his
passage, and bounded upstairs to judge for himself of his
child&rsquo;s condition.&nbsp; She looked so frankly discomfited
that I for a moment believed her about to give him chase.&nbsp;
But she resigned herself with a sigh and her eyes turned,
ruefully and without a ray, to the lamplit room where various
books at which I had been looking were pulled out of their places
on the shelves and the fumes of tobacco hung in mid-air.&nbsp; I
bade her good-night and then, without intention, by a kind of
fatality, a perversity that had already made me address her
overmuch on that question of her husband&rsquo;s powers, I
alluded to the precious proof-sheets with which Ambient had
entrusted me and which I nursed there under my arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the opening chapters of his new book,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy my satisfaction at being allowed to
carry them to my room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away, leaving me to take my candlestick from the
table in the hall; but before we separated, thinking it
apparently a good occasion to let me know once for all since I
was beginning, it would seem, to be quite &ldquo;thick&rdquo;
with my host&mdash;that there was no fitness in my appealing to
her for sympathy in such a case; before we separated, I say, she
remarked to me with her quick fine well-bred inveterate curtness:
&ldquo;I daresay you attribute to me ideas I haven&rsquo;t
got.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t take that sort of interest in my
husband&rsquo;s proof-sheets.&nbsp; I consider his writings most
objectionable!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>III</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> an odd colloquy the next
morning with Miss Ambient, whom I found strolling in the garden
before breakfast.&nbsp; The whole place looked as fresh and trim,
amid the twitter of the birds, as if, an hour before, the
housemaids had been turned into it with their dust-pans and
feather-brushes.&nbsp; I almost hesitated to light a cigarette
and was doubly startled when, in the act of doing so, I suddenly
saw the sister of my host, who had, at the best, something of the
weirdness of an apparition, stand before me.&nbsp; She might have
been posing for her photograph.&nbsp; Her sad-coloured robe
arranged itself in serpentine folds at her feet; her hands locked
themselves listlessly together in front; her chin rested on a
cinque-cento ruff.&nbsp; The first thing I did after bidding her
good-morning was to ask her for news of her little
nephew&mdash;to express the hope she had heard he was
better.&nbsp; She was able to gratify this trust&mdash;she spoke
as if we might expect to see him during the day.&nbsp; We walked
through the shrubberies together and she gave me further light on
her brother&rsquo;s household, which offered me an opportunity to
repeat to her what his wife had so startled and distressed me
with the night before.&nbsp; <i>Was</i> it the sorry truth that
she thought his productions objectionable?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t usually come out with that so
soon!&rdquo; Miss Ambient returned in answer to my
breathlessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lady,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;she saw I&rsquo;m a
fanatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she won&rsquo;t like you for that.&nbsp; But you
mustn&rsquo;t mind, if the rest of us like you!&nbsp; Beatrice
thinks a work of art ought to have a &lsquo;purpose.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But she&rsquo;s a charming woman&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think her
charming?&nbsp; I find in her quite the grand air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very beautiful,&rdquo; I produced with an
effort; while I reflected that though it was apparently true that
Mark Ambient was mismated it was also perceptible that his sister
was perfidious.&nbsp; She assured me her brother and his wife had
no other difference but this&mdash;one that she thought his
writings immoral and his influence pernicious.&nbsp; It was a
fixed idea; she was afraid of these things for the child.&nbsp; I
answered that it was in all conscience enough, the trifle of a
woman&rsquo;s regarding her husband&rsquo;s mind as a well of
corruption, and she seemed much struck with the novelty of my
remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there hasn&rsquo;t been any of the sort
of trouble that there so often is among married people,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you can judge for yourself that
Beatrice isn&rsquo;t at all&mdash;well, whatever they call it
when a woman kicks over!&nbsp; And poor Mark doesn&rsquo;t make
love to other people either.&nbsp; You might think he would, but
I assure you he doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; All the same of course, from
her point of view, you know, she has a dread of my
brother&rsquo;s influence on the child on the formation of his
character, his &lsquo;ideals,&rsquo; poor little brat, his
principles.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as if it were a subtle poison or a
contagion&mdash;something that would rub off on his tender
sensibility when his father kisses him or holds him on his
knee.&nbsp; If she could she&rsquo;d prevent Mark from even so
much as touching him.&nbsp; Every one knows it&mdash;visitors see
it for themselves; so there&rsquo;s no harm in my telling
you.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it excessively odd?&nbsp; It comes from
Beatrice&rsquo;s being so religious and so tremendously
moral&mdash;so <i>&agrave; cheval</i> on fifty thousand
<i>riguardi</i>.&nbsp; And then of course we mustn&rsquo;t
forget,&rdquo; my companion added, a little unexpectedly, to this
polyglot proposition, &ldquo;that some of Mark&rsquo;s ideas
are&mdash;well, really&mdash;rather impossible, don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected as we went into the house, where we found Ambient
unfolding <i>The Observer</i> at the breakfast-table, that none
of them were probably quite so &ldquo;impossible, don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo; as his sister.&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient, a little
&ldquo;the worse,&rdquo; as was mentioned, for her ministrations,
during the night, to Dolcino, didn&rsquo;t appear at
breakfast.&nbsp; Her husband described her, however, as hoping to
go to church.&nbsp; I afterwards learnt that she did go, but
nothing naturally was less on the cards than that we should
accompany her.&nbsp; It was while the church-bell droned near at
hand that the author of &ldquo;Beltraffio&rdquo; led me forth for
the ramble he had spoken of in his note.&nbsp; I shall attempt
here no record of where we went or of what we saw.&nbsp; We kept
to the fields and copses and commons, and breathed the same sweet
air as the nibbling donkeys and the browsing sheep, whose
woolliness seemed to me, in those early days of acquaintance with
English objects, but part of the general texture of the small
dense landscape, which looked as if the harvest were gathered by
the shears and with all nature bleating and braying for the
violence.&nbsp; Everything was full of expression for Mark
Ambient&rsquo;s visitor&mdash;from the big bandy-legged geese
whose whiteness was a &ldquo;note&rdquo; amid all the tones of
green as they wandered beside a neat little oval pool, the
foreground of a thatched and whitewashed inn, with a grassy
approach and a pictorial sign&mdash;from these humble wayside
animals to the crests of high woods which let a gable or a
pinnacle peep here and there and looked even at a distance like
trees of good company, conscious of an individual profile.&nbsp;
I admired the hedge-rows, I plucked the faint-hued heather, and I
was for ever stopping to say how charming I thought the
thread-like footpaths across the fields, which wandered in a
diagonal of finer grain from one smooth stile to another.&nbsp;
Mark Ambient was abundantly good-natured and was as much struck,
dear man, with some of my observations as I was with the literary
allusions of the landscape.&nbsp; We sat and smoked on stiles,
broaching paradoxes in the decent English air; we took short cuts
across a park or two where the bracken was deep and my companion
nodded to the old woman at the gate; we skirted rank coverts
which rustled here and there as we passed, and we stretched
ourselves at last on a heathery hillside where if the sun
wasn&rsquo;t too hot neither was the earth too cold, and where
the country lay beneath us in a rich blue mist.&nbsp; Of course I
had already told him what I thought of his new novel, having the
previous night read every word of the opening chapters before I
went to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not without hope of being able to make it
decent enough,&rdquo; he said as I went back to the subject while
we turned up our heels to the sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least the
people who dislike my stuff&mdash;and there are plenty of them, I
believe&mdash;will dislike this thing (if it does turn out well)
most.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the first time I had heard him allude
to the people who couldn&rsquo;t read him&mdash;a class so
generally conceived to sit heavy on the consciousness of the man
of letters.&nbsp; A being organised for literature as Mark
Ambient was must certainly have had the normal proportion of
sensitiveness, of irritability; the artistic <i>ego</i>, capable
in some cases of such monstrous development, must have been in
his composition sufficiently erect and active.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t therefore go so far as to say that he never thought
of his detractors or that he had any illusions with regard to the
number of his admirers&mdash;he could never so far have deceived
himself as to believe he was popular, but I at least then judged
(and had occasion to be sure later on) that stupidity ruffled him
visibly but little, that he had an air of thinking it quite
natural he should leave many simple folk, tasting of him, as
simple as ever he found them, and that he very seldom talked
about the newspapers, which, by the way, were always even
abnormally vulgar about him.&nbsp; Of course he may have thought
them over&mdash;the newspapers&mdash;night and day; the only
point I make is that he didn&rsquo;t show it while at the same
time he didn&rsquo;t strike one as a man actively on his
guard.&nbsp; I may add that, touching his hope of making the work
on which he was then engaged the best of his books, it was only
partly carried out.&nbsp; That place belongs incontestably to
&ldquo;Beltraffio,&rdquo; in spite of the beauty of certain parts
of its successor.&nbsp; I quite believe, however, that he had at
the moment of which I speak no sense of having declined; he was
in love with his idea, which was indeed magnificent, and though
for him, as I suppose for every sane artist, the act of execution
had in it as much torment as joy, he saw his result grow like the
crescent of the young moon and promise to fill the disk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to be truer than I&rsquo;ve ever been,&rdquo; he
said, settling himself on his back with his hands clasped behind
his head; &ldquo;I want to give the impression of life
itself.&nbsp; No, you may say what you will, I&rsquo;ve always
arranged things too much, always smoothed them down and rounded
them off and tucked them in&mdash;done everything to them that
life doesn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a slave to the old
superstitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You a slave, my dear Mark Ambient?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
the freest imagination of our day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more shame to me to have done some of the
things I have!&nbsp; The reconciliation of the two women in
&lsquo;Natalina,&rsquo; for instance, which could never really
have taken place.&nbsp; That sort of thing&rsquo;s
ignoble&mdash;I blush when I think of it!&nbsp; This new affair
must be a golden vessel, filled with the purest distillation of
the actual; and oh how it worries me, the shaping of the vase,
the hammering of the metal!&nbsp; I have to hammer it so fine, so
smooth; I don&rsquo;t do more than an inch or two a day.&nbsp;
And all the while I have to be so careful not to let a drop of
the liquor escape!&nbsp; When I see the kind of things Life
herself, the brazen hussy, does, I despair of ever catching her
peculiar trick.&nbsp; She has an impudence, Life!&nbsp; If one
risked a fiftieth part of the effects she risks!&nbsp; It takes
ever so long to believe it.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know yet, my
dear youth.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t till one has been watching her
some forty years that one finds out half of what she&rsquo;s up
to!&nbsp; Therefore one&rsquo;s earlier things must inevitably
contain a mass of rot.&nbsp; And with what one sees, on one side,
with its tongue in its cheek, defying one to be real enough, and
on the other the <i>bonnes gens</i> rolling up their eyes at
one&rsquo;s cynicism, the situation has elements of the ludicrous
which the poor reproducer himself is doubtless in a position to
appreciate better than any one else.&nbsp; Of course one
mustn&rsquo;t worry about the <i>bonnes gens</i>,&rdquo; Mark
Ambient went on while my thoughts reverted to his ladylike wife
as interpreted by his remarkable sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sink your shaft deep and polish the plate through
which people look into it&mdash;that&rsquo;s what your work
consists of,&rdquo; I remember ingeniously observing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah polishing one&rsquo;s plate&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
torment of execution!&rdquo; he exclaimed, jerking himself up and
sitting forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;The effort to arrive at a surface,
if you think anything of that decent sort necessary&mdash;some
people don&rsquo;t, happily for them!&nbsp; My dear fellow, if
you could see the surface I dream of as compared with the one
with which I&rsquo;ve to content myself.&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s
really too short for art&mdash;one hasn&rsquo;t time to make
one&rsquo;s shell ideally hard.&nbsp; Firm and bright, firm and
bright is very well to say&mdash;the devilish thing has a way
sometimes of being bright, and even of being hard, as mere tough
frozen pudding is hard, without being firm.&nbsp; When I rap it
with my knuckles it doesn&rsquo;t give the right sound.&nbsp;
There are horrible sandy stretches where I&rsquo;ve taken the
wrong turn because I couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me find the
right.&nbsp; If you knew what a dunce I am sometimes!&nbsp; Such
things figure to me now base pimples and ulcers on the brow of
beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very bad, very bad,&rdquo; I said as
gravely as I could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very bad?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re the highest social
offence I know; it ought&mdash;it absolutely ought; I&rsquo;m
quite serious&mdash;to be capital.&nbsp; If I knew I should be
publicly thrashed else I&rsquo;d manage to find the true
word.&nbsp; The people who can&rsquo;t&mdash;some of them
don&rsquo;t so much as know it when they see it&mdash;would shut
their inkstands, and we shouldn&rsquo;t be deluged by this flood
of rubbish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to repeat everything that passed between
us, nor to explain just how it was that, every moment I spent in
his company, Mark Ambient revealed to me more and more the
consistency of his creative spirit, the spirit in him that felt
all life as plastic material.&nbsp; I could but envy him the
force of that passion, and it was at any rate through the receipt
of this impression that by the time we returned I had gained the
sense of intimacy with him that I have noted.&nbsp; Before we got
up for the homeward stretch he alluded to his wife&rsquo;s having
once&mdash;or perhaps more than once&mdash;asked him whether he
should like Dolcino to read &ldquo;Beltraffio.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
must have been unaware at the moment of all that this conveyed to
me&mdash;as well doubtless of my extreme curiosity to hear what
he had replied.&nbsp; He had said how much he hoped Dolcino would
read <i>all</i> his works&mdash;when he was twenty; he should
like him to know what his father had done.&nbsp; Before twenty it
would be useless; he wouldn&rsquo;t understand them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And meanwhile do you propose to hide them&mdash;to lock
them up in a drawer?&rdquo; Mrs. Ambient had proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;we must simply tell him they&rsquo;re not
intended for small boys.&nbsp; If you bring him up properly after
that he won&rsquo;t touch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Mrs. Ambient had made answer that it might be very
awkward when he was about fifteen, say; and I asked her husband
if it were his opinion in general, then, that young people
shouldn&rsquo;t read novels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good ones&mdash;certainly not!&rdquo; said my
companion.&nbsp; I suppose I had had other views, for I remember
saying that for myself I wasn&rsquo;t sure it was bad for them if
the novels were &ldquo;good&rdquo; to the right intensity of
goodness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bad for <i>them</i>, I don&rsquo;t say so
much!&rdquo; my companion returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;But very bad,
I&rsquo;m afraid, for the poor dear old novel
itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; That oblique accidental allusion to his
wife&rsquo;s attitude was followed by a greater breadth of
reference as we walked home.&nbsp; &ldquo;The difference between
us is simply the opposition between two distinct ways of looking
at the world, which have never succeeded in getting on together,
or in making any kind of common household, since the beginning of
time.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve borne all sorts of names, and my wife
would tell you it&rsquo;s the difference between Christian and
Pagan.&nbsp; I may be a pagan, but I don&rsquo;t like the name;
it sounds sectarian.&nbsp; She thinks me at any rate no better
than an ancient Greek.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the difference between
making the most of life and making the least, so that
you&rsquo;ll get another better one in some other time and
place.&nbsp; Will it be a sin to make the most of that one, too,
I wonder; and shall we have to be bribed off in the future state
as well as in the present?&nbsp; Perhaps I care too much for
beauty&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, I doubt if a poor devil
<i>can</i>; I delight in it, I adore it, I think of it
continually, I try to produce it, to reproduce it.&nbsp; My wife
holds that we shouldn&rsquo;t cultivate or enjoy it without
extraordinary precautions and reserves.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s always
afraid of it, always on her guard.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
it can ever have done to her, what grudge it owes her or what
resentment rides.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;s so pretty, too,
herself!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;s lovely?&nbsp;
She was at any rate when we married.&nbsp; At that time I
wasn&rsquo;t aware of that difference I speak of&mdash;I thought
it all came to the same thing: in the end, as they say.&nbsp;
Well, perhaps it will in the end.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what
the end will be.&nbsp; Moreover, I care for seeing things as they
are; that&rsquo;s the way I try to show them in any professed
picture.&nbsp; But you mustn&rsquo;t talk to Mrs. Ambient about
things as they are.&nbsp; She has a mortal dread of things as
they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s afraid of them for Dolcino,&rdquo; I said:
surprised a moment afterwards at being in a position&mdash;thanks
to Miss Ambient&mdash;to be so explanatory; and surprised even
now that Mark shouldn&rsquo;t have shown visibly that he wondered
what the deuce I knew about it.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t; he
simply declared with a tenderness that touched me: &ldquo;Ah
nothing shall ever hurt <i>him</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told me more about his wife before we arrived at the gate
of home, and if he be judged to have aired overmuch his grievance
I&rsquo;m afraid I must admit that he had some of the foibles as
well as the gifts of the artistic temperament; adding, however,
instantly that hitherto, to the best of my belief, he had rarely
let this particular cat out of the bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;She thinks
me immoral&mdash;that&rsquo;s the long and short of it,&rdquo; he
said as we paused outside a moment and his hand rested on one of
the bars of his gate; while his conscious expressive perceptive
eyes&mdash;the eyes of a foreigner, I had begun to account them,
much more than of the usual Englishman&mdash;viewing me now
evidently as quite a familiar friend, took part in the
declaration.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange when one thinks
it all over, and there&rsquo;s a grand comicality in it that I
should like to bring out.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a very nice woman,
extraordinarily well-behaved, upright and clever and with a
tremendous lot of good sense about a good many matters.&nbsp; Yet
her conception of a novel&mdash;she has explained it to me once
or twice, and she doesn&rsquo;t do it badly as
exposition&mdash;is a thing so false that it makes me
blush.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a thing so hollow, so dishonest, so
lying, in which life is so blinked and blinded, so dodged and
disfigured, that it makes my ears burn.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s two
different ways of looking at the whole affair,&rdquo; he
repeated, pushing open the gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re
irreconcilable!&rdquo; he added with a sigh.&nbsp; We went
forward to the house, but on the walk, half-way to the door, he
stopped and said to me: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going into this
kind of thing there&rsquo;s a fact you should know beforehand; it
may save you some disappointment.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a hatred of
art, there&rsquo;s a hatred of literature&mdash;I mean of the
genuine kinds.&nbsp; Oh the shams&mdash;those they&rsquo;ll
swallow by the bucket!&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked up at the charming
house, with its genial colour and crookedness, and I answered
with a smile that those evil passions might exist, but that I
should never have expected to find them there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah it
doesn&rsquo;t matter after all,&rdquo; he a bit nervously
laughed; which I was glad to hear, for I was reproaching myself
with having worked him up.</p>
<p>If I had it soon passed off, for at luncheon he was
delightful; strangely delightful considering that the difference
between himself and his wife was, as he had said,
irreconcilable.&nbsp; He had the art, by his manner, by his
smile, by his natural amenity, of reducing the importance of it
in the common concerns of life; and Mrs. Ambient, I must add,
lent herself to this transaction with a very good grace.&nbsp; I
watched her at table for further illustrations of that fixed idea
of which Miss Ambient had spoken to me; for in the light of the
united revelations of her sister-in-law and her husband she had
come to seem to me almost a sinister personage.&nbsp; Yet the
signs of a sombre fanaticism were not more immediately striking
in her than before; it was only after a while that her air of
incorruptible conformity, her tapering monosyllabic correctness,
began to affect me as in themselves a cold thin flame.&nbsp;
Certainly, at first, she resembled a woman with as few passions
as possible; but if she had a passion at all it would indeed be
that of Philistinism.&nbsp; She might have been (for there are
guardian-spirits, I suppose, of all great principles) the very
angel of the pink of propriety&mdash;putting the pink for a
principle, though I&rsquo;d rather put some dismal cold
blue.&nbsp; Mark Ambient, apparently, ten years before, had
simply and quite inevitably taken her for an angel, without
asking himself of what.&nbsp; He had been right in calling my
attention to her beauty.&nbsp; In looking for some explanation of
his original surrender to her I saw more than before that she
was, physically speaking, a wonderfully cultivated human
plant&mdash;that he might well have owed her a brief poetic
inspiration.&nbsp; It was impossible to be more propped and
pencilled, more delicately tinted and petalled.</p>
<p>If I had had it in my heart to think my host a little of a
hypocrite for appearing to forget at table everything he had said
to me in our walk, I should instantly have cancelled such a
judgement on reflecting that the good news his wife was able to
give him about their little boy was ground enough for any
optimistic reaction.&nbsp; It may have come partly, too, from a
certain compunction at having breathed to me at all harshly on
the cool fair lady who sat there&mdash;a desire to prove himself
not after all so mismated.&nbsp; Dolcino continued to be much
better, and it had been promised him he should come downstairs
after his dinner.&nbsp; As soon as we had risen from our own meal
Mark slipped away, evidently for the purpose of going to his
child; and no sooner had I observed this than I became aware his
wife had simultaneously vanished.&nbsp; It happened that Miss
Ambient and I, both at the same moment, saw the tail of her dress
whisk out of a doorway; an incident that led the young lady to
smile at me as if I now knew all the secrets of the
Ambients.&nbsp; I passed with her into the garden and we sat down
on a dear old bench that rested against the west wall of the
house.&nbsp; It was a perfect spot for the middle period of a
Sunday in June, and its felicity seemed to come partly from an
antique sun-dial which, rising in front of us and forming the
centre of a small intricate parterre, measured the moments ever
so slowly and made them safe for leisure and talk.&nbsp; The
garden bloomed in the suffused afternoon, the tall beeches stood
still for an example, and, behind and above us, a rose tree of
many seasons, clinging to the faded grain of the brick, expressed
the whole character of the scene in a familiar exquisite
smell.&nbsp; It struck me as a place to offer genius every favour
and sanction&mdash;not to bristle with challenges and
checks.&nbsp; Miss Ambient asked me if I had enjoyed my walk with
her brother and whether we had talked of many things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of most things,&rdquo; I freely allowed, though I
remembered we hadn&rsquo;t talked of Miss Ambient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you think some of his theories are very
peculiar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I guess I agree with them all.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
very particular, for Miss Ambient&rsquo;s entertainment, to
guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think art&rsquo;s everything?&rdquo; she put to
me in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In art, of course I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think beauty&rsquo;s everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s a big word, which I think we should
use as little as possible.&nbsp; But how can we not want
beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah there you are!&rdquo; she sighed, though I
didn&rsquo;t quite know what she meant by it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course it&rsquo;s difficult for a woman to judge how far to
go,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I adore everything that
gives a charm to life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m intensely sensitive to
form.&nbsp; But sometimes I draw back&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see
what I mean?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite see where I shall be
landed.&nbsp; I only want to be quiet, after all,&rdquo; Miss
Ambient continued as if she had long been baffled of this modest
desire.&nbsp; &ldquo;And one must be good, at any rate, must not
one?&rdquo; she pursued with a dubious quaver&mdash;an intimation
apparently that what I might say one way or the other would
settle it for her.&nbsp; It was difficult for me to be very
original in reply, and I&rsquo;m afraid I repaid her confidence
with an unblushing platitude.&nbsp; I remember, moreover,
attaching to it an inquiry, equally destitute of freshness and
still more wanting perhaps in tact, as to whether she
didn&rsquo;t mean to go to church, since that was an obvious way
of being good.&nbsp; She made answer that she had performed this
duty in the morning, and that for her, of Sunday afternoons,
supreme virtue consisted in answering the week&rsquo;s
letters.&nbsp; Then suddenly and without transition she brought
out: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a mistake about Dolcino&rsquo;s
being better.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen him and he&rsquo;s not at all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered, and somehow I think I scarcely believed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely his mother would know, wouldn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She appeared for a moment to be counting the leaves on one of
the great beeches.&nbsp; &ldquo;As regards most matters one can
easily say what, in a given situation, my sister-in-law will, or
would, do.&nbsp; But in the present case there are strange
elements at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange elements?&nbsp; Do you mean in the constitution
of the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean in my sister-in-law&rsquo;s
feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elements of affection of course; elements of
anxiety,&rdquo; I concurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why do you call
them strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She repeated my words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Elements of affection,
elements of anxiety.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s very anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Ambient put me indescribably ill at ease; she almost
scared me, and I wished she would go and write her letters.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His father will have seen him now,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and if he&rsquo;s not satisfied he will send for the
doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor ought to have been here this morning,&rdquo;
she promptly returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;He lives only two miles
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected that all this was very possibly but a part of the
general tragedy of Miss Ambient&rsquo;s view of things; yet I
asked her why she hadn&rsquo;t urged that view on her
sister-in-law.&nbsp; She answered me with a smile of
extraordinary significance and observed that I must have very
little idea of her &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; relations with
Beatrice; but I must do her the justice that she re-enforced this
a little by the plea that any distinguishable alarm of
Mark&rsquo;s was ground enough for a difference of his
wife&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was always nervous about the child, and as
they were predestined by nature to take opposite views, the only
thing for the mother was to cultivate a false optimism.&nbsp; In
Mark&rsquo;s absence and that of his betrayed fear she would have
been less easy.&nbsp; I remembered what he had said to me about
their dealings with their son&mdash;that between them
they&rsquo;d probably put an end to him; but I didn&rsquo;t
repeat this to Miss Ambient: the less so that just then her
brother emerged from the house, carrying the boy in his
arms.&nbsp; Close behind him moved his wife, grave and pale; the
little sick face was turned over Ambient&rsquo;s shoulder and
toward the mother.&nbsp; We rose to receive the group, and as
they came near us Dolcino twisted himself about.&nbsp; His
enchanting eyes showed me a smile of recognition, in which, for
the moment, I should have taken a due degree of comfort.&nbsp;
Miss Ambient, however, received another impression, and I make
haste to say that her quick sensibility, which visibly went out
to the child, argues that in spite of her affectations she might
have been of some human use.&nbsp; &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do at
all&mdash;it won&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; she said to me under
her breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall speak to Mark about the
Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her small nephew was rather white, but the main difference I
saw in him was that he was even more beautiful than the day
before.&nbsp; He had been dressed in his festal garments&mdash;a
velvet suit and a crimson sash&mdash;and he looked like a little
invalid prince too young to know condescension and smiling
familiarly on his subjects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put him down, Mark, he&rsquo;s not a bit at his
ease,&rdquo; Mrs. Ambient said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like to stand on your feet, my boy?&rdquo;
his father asked.</p>
<p>He made a motion that quickly responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes;
I&rsquo;m remarkably well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark placed him on the ground; he had shining pointed shoes
with enormous bows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you happy now, Mr.
Ambient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;m particularly happy,&rdquo; Dolcino
replied.&nbsp; But the words were scarce out of his mouth when
his mother caught him up and, in a moment, holding him on her
knees, took her place on the bench where Miss Ambient and I had
been sitting.&nbsp; This young lady said something to her
brother, in consequence of which the two wandered away into the
garden together.</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>IV</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">remained</span> with Mrs. Ambient, but
as a servant had brought out a couple of chairs I wasn&rsquo;t
obliged to seat myself beside her.&nbsp; Our conversation failed
of ease, and I, for my part, felt there would be a shade of
hypocrisy in my now trying to make myself agreeable to the
partner of my friend&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
dislike her&mdash;I rather admired her; but I was aware that I
differed from her inexpressibly.&nbsp; Then I suspected, what I
afterwards definitely knew and have already intimated, that the
poor lady felt small taste for her husband&rsquo;s so undisguised
disciple; and this of course was not encouraging.&nbsp; She
thought me an obtrusive and designing, even perhaps a depraved,
young man whom a perverse Providence had dropped upon their quiet
lawn to flatter his worst tendencies.&nbsp; She did me the honour
to say to Miss Ambient, who repeated the speech, that she
didn&rsquo;t know when she had seen their companion take such a
fancy to a visitor; and she measured apparently my evil influence
by Mark&rsquo;s appreciation of my society.&nbsp; I had a
consciousness, not oppressive but quite sufficient, of all this;
though I must say that if it chilled my flow of small-talk it yet
didn&rsquo;t prevent my thinking the beautiful mother and
beautiful child, interlaced there against their background of
roses, a picture such as I doubtless shouldn&rsquo;t soon see
again.&nbsp; I was free, I supposed, to go into the house and
write letters, to sit in the drawing-room, to repair to my own
apartment and take a nap; but the only use I made of my freedom
was to linger still in my chair and say to myself that the light
hand of Sir Joshua might have painted Mark Ambient&rsquo;s wife
and son.&nbsp; I found myself looking perpetually at the latter
small mortal, who looked constantly back at me, and that was
enough to detain me.&nbsp; With these vaguely-amused eyes he
smiled, and I felt it an absolute impossibility to abandon a
child with such an expression.&nbsp; His attention never strayed;
it attached itself to my face as if among all the small incipient
things of his nature throbbed a desire to say something to
me.&nbsp; If I could have taken him on my own knee he perhaps
would have managed to say it; but it would have been a critical
matter to ask his mother to give him up, and it has remained a
constant regret for me that on that strange Sunday afternoon I
didn&rsquo;t even for a moment hold Dolcino in my arms.&nbsp; He
had said he felt remarkably well and was especially happy; but
though peace may have been with him as he pillowed his charming
head on his mother&rsquo;s breast, dropping his little crimson
silk legs from her lap, I somehow didn&rsquo;t think security
was.&nbsp; He made no attempt to walk about; he was content to
swing his legs softly and strike one as languid and angelic.</p>
<p>Mark returned to us with his sister; and Miss Ambient,
repeating her mention of the claims of her correspondence, passed
into the house.&nbsp; Mark came and stood in front of his wife,
looking down at the child, who immediately took hold of his hand
and kept it while he stayed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think Mackintosh
ought to see him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll walk
over and fetch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gwendolen&rsquo;s idea, I suppose,&rdquo;
Mrs. Ambient replied very sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not such an out-of-the-way idea when
one&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s ill,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ill, papa; I&rsquo;m much better
now,&rdquo; sounded in the boy&rsquo;s silver pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the truth, or are you only saying it to be
agreeable?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a great idea of being agreeable,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child seemed to meditate on this distinction, this
imputation, for a moment; then his exaggerated eyes, which had
wandered, caught my own as I watched him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
<i>you</i> think me agreeable?&rdquo; he inquired with the
candour of his age and with a look that made his father turn
round to me laughing and ask, without saying it,
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he adorable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you hop about, if you feel so
lusty?&rdquo; Ambient went on while his son swung his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because mamma&rsquo;s holding me close!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I know how mamma holds you when I come
near!&rdquo; cried Mark with a grimace at his wife.</p>
<p>She turned her charming eyes up to him without deprecation or
concession.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can go for Mackintosh if you
like.&nbsp; I think myself it would be better.&nbsp; You ought to
drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says that to get me away,&rdquo; he put to me with
a gaiety that I thought a little false; after which he started
for the Doctor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I remained there with Mrs. Ambient, though even our exchange
of twaddle had run very thin.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s little fixed
white face seemed, as before, to plead with me to stay, and after
a while it produced still another effect, a very curious one,
which I shall find it difficult to express.&nbsp; Of course I
expose myself to the charge of an attempt to justify by a
strained logic after the fact a step which may have been on my
part but the fruit of a native want of discretion; and indeed the
traceable consequences of that perversity were too lamentable to
leave me any desire to trifle with the question.&nbsp; All I can
say is that I acted in perfect good faith and that
Dolcino&rsquo;s friendly little gaze gradually kindled the spark
of my inspiration.&nbsp; What helped it to glow were the other
influences&mdash;the silent suggestive garden-nook, the perfect
opportunity (if it was not an opportunity for that it was an
opportunity for nothing) and the plea I speak of, which issued
from the child&rsquo;s eyes and seemed to make him say:
&ldquo;The mother who bore me and who presses me here to her
bosom&mdash;sympathetic little organism that I am&mdash;has
really the kind of sensibility she has been represented to you as
lacking, if you only look for it patiently and
respectfully.&nbsp; How is it conceivable she shouldn&rsquo;t
have it?&nbsp; How is it possible that <i>I</i> should have so
much of it&mdash;for I&rsquo;m quite full of it, dear strange
gentleman&mdash;if it weren&rsquo;t also in some degree in
her?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m my great father&rsquo;s child, but I&rsquo;m
also my beautiful mother&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;m sorry for the
difference between them!&rdquo;&nbsp; So it shaped itself before
me, the vision of reconciling Mrs. Ambient with her husband, of
putting an end to their ugly difference.&nbsp; The project was
absurd of course, for had I not had his word for it&mdash;spoken
with all the bitterness of experience&mdash;that the gulf
dividing them was well-nigh bottomless?&nbsp; Nevertheless, a
quarter of an hour after Mark had left us, I observed to my
hostess that I couldn&rsquo;t get over what she had told me the
night before about her thinking her husband&rsquo;s compositions
&ldquo;objectionable.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had been so very sorry to
hear it, had thought of it constantly and wondered whether it
mightn&rsquo;t be possible to make her change her mind.&nbsp; She
gave me a great cold stare, meant apparently as an admonition to
me to mind my business.&nbsp; I wish I had taken this mute
counsel, but I didn&rsquo;t take it.&nbsp; I went on to remark
that it seemed an immense pity so much that was interesting
should be lost on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s lost upon me,&rdquo; she said in a tone
that didn&rsquo;t make the contradiction less.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know they&rsquo;re very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like papa&rsquo;s books?&rdquo; Dolcino
asked, addressing his mother but still looking at me.&nbsp; Then
he added to me: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you read them to me, American
gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather tell you some stories of my
own,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know some that are awfully
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you tell them?&nbsp; To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow with pleasure, if that suits you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother took this in silence.&nbsp; Her husband, during our
walk, had asked me to remain another day; my promise to her son
was an implication that I had consented, and it wasn&rsquo;t
possible the news could please her.&nbsp; This ought doubtless to
have made me more careful as to what I said next, but all I can
plead is that it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I soon mentioned that just
after leaving her the evening before, and after hearing her apply
to her husband&rsquo;s writings the epithet already quoted, I had
on going up to my room sat down to the perusal of those sheets of
his new book that he had been so good as to lend me.&nbsp; I had
sat entranced till nearly three in the morning&mdash;I had read
them twice over.&nbsp; &ldquo;You say you haven&rsquo;t looked at
them.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s such a pity you
shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Do let me beg you to take them up.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re so very remarkable.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
they&rsquo;ll convert you.&nbsp; They place him
in&mdash;really&mdash;such a dazzling light.&nbsp; All
that&rsquo;s best in him is there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no doubt
it&rsquo;s a great liberty, my saying all this; but pardon me,
and <i>do</i> read them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do read them, mamma!&rdquo; the boy again sweetly
shrilled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do read them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent her head and closed his lips with a kiss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course I know he has worked immensely over them,&rdquo;
she said; after which she made no remark, but attached her eyes
thoughtfully to the ground.&nbsp; The tone of these last words
was such as to leave me no spirit for further pressure, and after
hinting at a fear that her husband mightn&rsquo;t have caught the
Doctor I got up and took a turn about the grounds.&nbsp; When I
came back ten minutes later she was still in her place watching
her boy, who had fallen asleep in her lap.&nbsp; As I drew near
she put her finger to her lips and a short time afterwards rose,
holding him; it being now best, she said, that she should take
him upstairs.&nbsp; I offered to carry him and opened my arms for
the purpose; but she thanked me and turned away with the child
still in her embrace, his head on her shoulder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very strong,&rdquo; was her last word as she
passed into the house, her slim flexible figure bent backward
with the filial weight.&nbsp; So I never laid a longing hand on
Dolcino.</p>
<p>I betook myself to Ambient&rsquo;s study, delighted to have a
quiet hour to look over his books by myself.&nbsp; The windows
were open to the garden; the sunny stillness, the mild light of
the English summer, filled the room without quite chasing away
the rich dusky tone that was a part of its charm and that abode
in the serried shelves where old morocco exhaled the fragrance of
curious learning, as well as in the brighter intervals where
prints and medals and miniatures were suspended on a surface of
faded stuff.&nbsp; The place had both colour and quiet; I thought
it a perfect room for work and went so far as to say to myself
that, if it were mine to sit and scribble in, there was no
knowing but I might learn to write as well as the author of
&ldquo;Beltraffio.&rdquo;&nbsp; This distinguished man still
didn&rsquo;t reappear, and I rummaged freely among his
treasures.&nbsp; At last I took down a book that detained me a
while and seated myself in a fine old leather chair by the window
to turn it over.&nbsp; I had been occupied in this way for half
an hour&mdash;a good part of the afternoon had waned&mdash;when I
became conscious of another presence in the room and, looking up
from my quarto, saw that Mrs. Ambient, having pushed open the
door quite again in the same noiseless way marking or disguising
her entrance the night before, had advanced across the
threshold.&nbsp; On seeing me she stopped; she had not, I think,
expected to find me.&nbsp; But her hesitation was only of a
moment; she came straight to her husband&rsquo;s writing-table as
if she were looking for something.&nbsp; I got up and asked her
if I could help her.&nbsp; She glanced about an instant and then
put her hand upon a roll of papers which I recognised, as I had
placed it on that spot at the early hour of my descent from my
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the new book?&rdquo; she asked, holding it
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very sheets,&rdquo; I smiled; &ldquo;with precious
annotations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to take your advice&rdquo;&mdash;and she tucked
the little bundle under her arm.&nbsp; I congratulated her
cordially and ventured to make of my triumph, as I presumed to
call it, a subject of pleasantry.&nbsp; But she was perfectly
grave and turned away from me, as she had presented herself,
without relaxing her rigour; after which I settled down to my
quarto again with the reflexion that Mrs. Ambient was truly an
eccentric.&nbsp; My triumph, too, suddenly seemed to me rather
vain.&nbsp; A woman who couldn&rsquo;t unbend at a moment
exquisitely indicated would never understand Mark Ambient.&nbsp;
He came back to us at last in person, having brought the Doctor
with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was away from home,&rdquo; Mark said,
&ldquo;and I went after him to where he was supposed to be.&nbsp;
He had left the place, and I followed him to two or three others,
which accounts for my delay.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was now with Mrs.
Ambient, looking at the child, and was to see Mark again before
leaving the house.&nbsp; My host noticed at the end of two
minutes that the proof-sheets of his new book had been removed
from the table; and when I told him, in reply to his question as
to what I knew about them, that Mrs. Ambient had carried them off
to read he turned almost pale with surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
has suddenly made her so curious?&rdquo; he cried; and I was
obliged to tell him that I was at the bottom of the
mystery.&nbsp; I had had it on my conscience to assure her that
she really ought to know of what her husband was capable.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of what I&rsquo;m capable?&nbsp; Elle ne s&rsquo;en doute
que trop!&rdquo; said Ambient with a laugh; but he took my
meddling very good-naturedly and contented himself with adding
that he was really much afraid she would burn up the sheets, his
emendations and all, of which latter he had no duplicate.&nbsp;
The Doctor paid a long visit in the nursery, and before he came
down I retired to my own quarters, where I remained till
dinner-time.&nbsp; On entering the drawing-room at this hour I
found Miss Ambient in possession, as she had been the evening
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was right about Dolcino,&rdquo; she said, as soon as
she saw me, with an air of triumph that struck me as the climax
of perversity.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really very
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very ill!&nbsp; Why when I last saw him, at four
o&rsquo;clock, he was in fairly good form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a change for the worse, very sudden and
rapid, and when the Doctor got here he found diphtheritic
symptoms.&nbsp; He ought to have been called, as I knew, in the
morning, and the child oughtn&rsquo;t to have been brought into
the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady, he was very happy there,&rdquo; I
protested with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be very happy anywhere.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no
doubt he&rsquo;s very happy now, with his poor little
temperature&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; She dropped her voice as her
brother came in, and Mark let us know that as a matter of course
Mrs. Ambient wouldn&rsquo;t appear.&nbsp; It was true the boy had
developed diphtheritic symptoms, but he was quiet for the present
and his mother earnestly watching him.&nbsp; She was a perfect
nurse, Mark said, and Mackintosh would come back at ten.&nbsp;
Our dinner wasn&rsquo;t very gay&mdash;with my host worried and
absent; and his sister annoyed me by her constant tacit
assumption, conveyed in the very way she nibbled her bread and
sipped her wine, of having &ldquo;told me so.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had
had no disposition to deny anything she might have told me, and I
couldn&rsquo;t see that her satisfaction in being justified by
the event relieved her little nephew&rsquo;s condition.&nbsp; The
truth is that, as the sequel was to prove, Miss Ambient had some
of the qualities of the sibyl and had therefore perhaps a right
to the sibylline contortions.&nbsp; Her brother was so
preoccupied that I felt my presence an indiscretion and was sorry
I had promised to remain over the morrow.&nbsp; I put it to Mark
that clearly I had best leave them in the morning; to which he
replied that, on the contrary, if he was to pass the next days in
the fidgets my company would distract his attention.&nbsp; The
fidgets had already begun for him, poor fellow; and as we sat in
his study with our cigars after dinner he wandered to the door
whenever he heard the sound of the Doctor&rsquo;s wheels.&nbsp;
Miss Ambient, who shared this apartment with us, gave me at such
moments significant glances; she had before rejoining us gone
upstairs to ask about the child.&nbsp; His mother and his nurse
gave a fair report, but Miss Ambient found his fever high and his
symptoms very grave.&nbsp; The Doctor came at ten o&rsquo;clock,
and I went to bed after hearing from Mark that he saw no present
cause for alarm.&nbsp; He had made every provision for the night
and was to return early in the morning.</p>
<p>I quitted my room as eight struck the next day and when I came
downstairs saw, through the open door of the house, Mrs. Ambient
standing at the front gate of the grounds in colloquy with
Mackintosh.&nbsp; She wore a white dressing-gown, but her shining
hair was carefully tucked away in its net, and in the morning
freshness, after a night of watching, she looked as much
&ldquo;the type of the lady&rdquo; as her sister-in-law had
described her.&nbsp; Her appearance, I suppose, ought to have
reassured me; but I was still nervous and uneasy, so that I
shrank from meeting her with the necessary challenge.&nbsp; None
the less, however, was I impatient to learn how the new day found
him; and as Mrs. Ambient hadn&rsquo;t seen me I passed into the
grounds by a roundabout way and, stopping at a further gate,
hailed the Doctor just as he was driving off.&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient
had returned to the house before he got into his cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, but as a friend of the family I should like
very much to hear about the little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stout sharp circumspect man looked at me from head to foot
and then said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say I haven&rsquo;t seen
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ambient came down to meet me as I alighted, and
told me he was sleeping so soundly, after a restless night, that
she didn&rsquo;t wish him disturbed.&nbsp; I assured her I
wouldn&rsquo;t disturb him, but she said he was quite safe now
and she could look after him herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&nbsp; Are you coming
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I come back!&rdquo;
cried the honest practitioner in high resentment.&nbsp; And the
horse started as he settled beside his man.</p>
<p>I wandered back into the garden, and five minutes later Miss
Ambient came forth from the house to greet me.&nbsp; She
explained that breakfast wouldn&rsquo;t be served for some time
and that she desired a moment herself with the Doctor.&nbsp; I
let her know that the good vexed man had come and departed, and I
repeated to her what he had told me about his dismissal.&nbsp;
This made Miss Ambient very serious, very serious indeed, and she
sank into a bench, with dilated eyes, hugging her elbows with
crossed arms.&nbsp; She indulged in many strange signs, she
confessed herself immensely distressed, and she finally told me
what her own last news of her nephew had been.&nbsp; She had sat
up very late&mdash;after me, after Mark&mdash;and before going to
bed had knocked at the door of the child&rsquo;s room, opened to
her by the nurse.&nbsp; This good woman had admitted her and she
had found him quiet, but flushed and &ldquo;unnatural,&rdquo;
with his mother sitting by his bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She held his
hand in one of hers,&rdquo; said Miss Ambient, &ldquo;and in the
other&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;the proof-sheets of
Mark&rsquo;s new book!&rdquo;&nbsp; She was reading them there
intently: &ldquo;did you ever hear of anything so
extraordinary?&nbsp; Such a very odd time to be reading an author
whom she never could abide!&rdquo;&nbsp; In her agitation Miss
Ambient was guilty of this vulgarism of speech, and I was so
impressed by her narrative that only in recalling her words later
did I notice the lapse.&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient had looked up from her
reading with her finger on her lips&mdash;I recognised the
gesture she had addressed me in the afternoon&mdash;and, though
the nurse was about to go to rest, had not encouraged her
sister-in-law to relieve her of any part of her vigil.&nbsp; But
certainly at that time the boy&rsquo;s state was far from
reassuring&mdash;his poor little breathing so painful; and what
change could have taken place in him in those few hours that
would justify Beatrice in denying Mackintosh access?&nbsp; This
was the moral of Miss Ambient&rsquo;s anecdote, the moral for
herself at least.&nbsp; The moral for me, rather, was that it
<i>was</i> a very singular time for Mrs. Ambient to be going into
a novelist she had never appreciated and who had simply happened
to be recommended to her by a young American she disliked.&nbsp;
I thought of her sitting there in the sick-chamber in the still
hours of the night and after the nurse had left her, turning and
turning those pages of genius and wrestling with their magical
influence.</p>
<p>I must be sparing of the minor facts and the later emotions of
this sojourn&mdash;it lasted but a few hours longer&mdash;and
devote but three words to my subsequent relations with
Ambient.&nbsp; They lasted five years&mdash;till his
death&mdash;and were full of interest, of satisfaction and, I may
add, of sadness.&nbsp; The main thing to be said of these years
is that I had a secret from him which I guarded to the end.&nbsp;
I believe he never suspected it, though of this I&rsquo;m not
absolutely sure.&nbsp; If he had so much as an inkling the line
he had taken, the line of absolute negation of the matter to
himself, shows an immense effort of the will.&nbsp; I may at last
lay bare my secret, giving it for what it is worth; now that the
main sufferer has gone, that he has begun to be alluded to as one
of the famous early dead and that his wife has ceased to survive
him; now, too, that Miss Ambient, whom I also saw at intervals
during the time that followed, has, with her embroideries and her
attitudes, her necromantic glances and strange intuitions,
retired to a Sisterhood, where, as I am told, she is deeply
immured and quite lost to the world.</p>
<p>Mark came in to breakfast after this lady and I had for some
time been seated there.&nbsp; He shook hands with me in silence,
kissed my companion, opened his letters and newspapers and
pretended to drink his coffee.&nbsp; But I took these movements
for mechanical and was little surprised when he suddenly pushed
away everything that was before him and, with his head in his
hands and his elbows on the table, sat staring strangely at the
cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, <i>caro fratello
mio</i>?&rdquo; Miss Ambient quavered, peeping from behind the
urn.</p>
<p>He answered nothing, but got up with a certain violence and
strode to the window.&nbsp; We rose to our feet, his relative and
I, by a common impulse, exchanging a glance of some alarm; and he
continued to stare into the garden.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
heaven&rsquo;s name what has got possession of Beatrice?&rdquo;
he cried at last, turning round on us a ravaged face.&nbsp; He
looked from one of us to the other&mdash;the appeal was addressed
to us alike.</p>
<p>Miss Ambient gave a shrug.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor Mark, Beatrice
is always&mdash;Beatrice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has locked herself up with the boy&mdash;bolted and
barred the door.&nbsp; She refuses to let me come near
him!&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She refused to let Mackintosh see him an hour
ago!&rdquo; Miss Ambient promptly returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refused to let Mackintosh see him?&nbsp; By heaven
I&rsquo;ll smash in the door!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mark brought his
fist down upon the sideboard, which he had now approached, so
that all the breakfast-service rang.</p>
<p>I begged Miss Ambient to go up and try to have speech of her
sister-in-law, and I drew Mark out into the garden.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re exceedingly nervous, and Mrs. Ambient&rsquo;s
probably right,&rdquo; I there undertook to plead.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Women know; women should be supreme in such a
situation.&nbsp; Trust a mother&mdash;a devoted mother, my dear
friend!&rdquo;&nbsp; With such words as these I tried to soothe
and comfort him, and, marvellous to relate, I succeeded, with the
help of many cigarettes, in making him walk about the garden and
talk, or suffer me at least to do so, for near an hour.&nbsp;
When about that time had elapsed his sister reappeared, reaching
us rapidly and with a convulsed face while she held her hand to
her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for the Doctor, Mark&mdash;go for the Doctor this
moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dying?&nbsp; Has she killed him?&rdquo; my poor
friend cried, flinging away his cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she has done!&nbsp; But
she&rsquo;s frightened, and now she wants the Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me he&rsquo;d be hanged if he came
back!&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt myself obliged to mention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely&mdash;therefore Mark himself must go for him,
and not a messenger.&nbsp; You must see him and tell him
it&rsquo;s to save your child.&nbsp; The trap has been
ordered&mdash;it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save him?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll save him, please
God!&rdquo; Ambient cried, bounding with his great strides across
the lawn.</p>
<p>As soon as he had gone I felt I ought to have volunteered in
his place, and I said as much to Miss Ambient; but she checked me
by grasping my arm while we heard the wheels of the dog-cart
rattle away from the gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
off&mdash;he&rsquo;s off&mdash;and now I can think!&nbsp; To get
him away&mdash;while I think&mdash;while I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you think of what, Miss Ambient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the unspeakable thing that has happened under this
roof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her manner was habitually that of such a prophetess of ill
that I at first allowed for some great extravagance.&nbsp; But I
looked at her hard, and the next thing felt myself turn
white.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dolcino <i>is</i> dying then&mdash;he&rsquo;s
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to save him.&nbsp; His mother has
let him die!&nbsp; I tell you that because you&rsquo;re
sympathetic, because you&rsquo;ve imagination,&rdquo; Miss
Ambient was good enough to add, interrupting my expression of
horror.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you had the idea of making
her read Mark&rsquo;s new book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has that to do with it?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
understand you.&nbsp; Your accusation&rsquo;s
monstrous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it all&mdash;I&rsquo;m not stupid,&rdquo; she
went on, heedless of my emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the book
that finished her&mdash;it was that decided her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decided her?&nbsp; Do you mean she has murdered her
child?&rdquo; I demanded, trembling at my own words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sacrificed him; she determined to do nothing to
make him live.&nbsp; Why else did she lock herself in, why else
did she turn away the Doctor?&nbsp; The book gave her a horror;
she determined to rescue him&mdash;to prevent him from ever being
touched.&nbsp; He had a crisis at two o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&nbsp; I know that from the nurse, who had left her then,
but whom, for a short time, she called back.&nbsp; The darling
got munch worse, but she insisted on the nurse&rsquo;s going back
to bed, and after that she was alone with him for
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened with a dread that stayed my credence, while she
stood there with her tearless glare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you pretend
then she has no pity, that she&rsquo;s cruel and
insane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She held him in her arms, she pressed him to her
breast, not to see him; but she gave him no remedies; she did
nothing the Doctor ordered.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s there
untouched.&nbsp; She has had the honesty not even to throw the
drugs away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dropped upon the nearest bench, overcome with my
dismay&mdash;quite as much at Miss Ambient&rsquo;s horrible
insistence and distinctness as at the monstrous meaning of her
words.&nbsp; Yet they came amazingly straight, and if they did
have a sense I saw myself too woefully figure in it.&nbsp; Had I
been then a proximate cause&mdash;?&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
very strange woman and you say incredible things,&rdquo; I could
only reply.</p>
<p>She had one of her tragic headshakes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think
it necessary to protest, but you&rsquo;re really quite ready to
believe me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve received an impression of my
sister-in-law&mdash;you&rsquo;ve guessed of what she&rsquo;s
capable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel bound to say what concession on this score
I made to Miss Ambient, who went on to relate to me that within
the last half-hour Beatrice had had a revulsion, that she was
tremendously frightened at what she had done; that her fright
itself betrayed her; and that she would now give heaven and earth
to save the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us hope she will!&rdquo; I
said, looking at my watch and trying to time poor Ambient;
whereupon my companion repeated all portentously &ldquo;Let us
hope so!&rdquo;&nbsp; When I asked her if she herself could do
nothing, and whether she oughtn&rsquo;t to be with her
sister-in-law, she replied: &ldquo;You had better go and
judge!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s like a wounded tigress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never saw Mrs. Ambient till six months after this, and
therefore can&rsquo;t pretend to have verified the
comparison.&nbsp; At the latter period she was again the type of
the perfect lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll treat him better
after this,&rdquo; I remember her sister-in-law&rsquo;s saying in
response to some quick outburst, on my part, of compassion for
her brother.&nbsp; Though I had been in the house but thirty-six
hours this young lady had treated me with extraordinary
confidence, and there was therefore a certain demand I might, as
such an intimate, make of her.&nbsp; I extracted from her a
pledge that she&rsquo;d never say to her brother what she had
just said to me, that she&rsquo;d let him form his own theory of
his wife&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; She agreed with me that there was
misery enough in the house without her contributing a new
anguish, and that Mrs. Ambient&rsquo;s proceedings might be
explained, to her husband&rsquo;s mind, by the extravagance of a
jealous devotion.&nbsp; Poor Mark came back with the Doctor much
sooner than we could have hoped, but we knew five minutes
afterwards that it was all too late.&nbsp; His sole, his adored
little son was more exquisitely beautiful in death than he had
been in life.&nbsp; Mrs. Ambient&rsquo;s grief was frantic; she
lost her head and said strange things.&nbsp; As for
Mark&rsquo;s&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t speak of that.&nbsp;
<i>Basta</i>, <i>basta</i>, as he used to say.&nbsp; Miss Ambient
kept her secret&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already had occasion to say that
she had her good points&mdash;but it rankled in her conscience
like a guilty participation and, I imagine, had something to do
with her ultimately retiring from the world.&nbsp; And, apropos
of consciences, the reader is now in a position to judge of my
compunction for my effort to convert my cold hostess.&nbsp; I
ought to mention that the death of her child in some degree
converted her.&nbsp; When the new book came out (it was long
delayed) she read it over as a whole, and her husband told me
that during the few supreme weeks before her death&mdash;she
failed rapidly after losing her son, sank into a consumption and
faded away at Mentone&mdash;she even dipped into the black
&ldquo;Beltraffio.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
